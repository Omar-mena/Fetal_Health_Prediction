# Fetal_Health_Prediction
In the Fetal Health Prediction project, I used the CatBoost model to predict the health of a fetal based on data from a Cardiotocogram exam.

CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm developed by Yandex that is designed to handle categorical data and missing values. It is a powerful tool for building machine learning models and has been shown to perform well on a variety of tasks.

In this project, we used CatBoost to build a model that could accurately predict the health of a fetal based on the Cardiotocogram data. The model was trained on a dataset that included 21 features relating to the electrical activity of the fetal heart, as well as a target variable indicating whether the fetal was healthy or not.

We evaluated the performance of the CatBoost model using a variety of metrics and found that it was able to make accurate predictions with a high degree of precision and recall. We also identified areas for improvement and will continue to work on optimizing the model for even better performance.
